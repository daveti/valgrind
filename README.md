Valgrind

Used to hold all Dave's hacks but yet not mainstreamed

Branches:

1. master: usually sync'd with the official Valgrind repo on sourceware
2. zircon: used to serve Zircon, including support for rdrand/rdseed/fsgsbase instructions


Acknowledgements:

1. Fortanix: for their development and open-source support
